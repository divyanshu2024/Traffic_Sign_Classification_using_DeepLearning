### Objectives

- Understand the theory and intuition behind __Deep Learning__ and __Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)__.
- Import Key python libraries, dataset and perform image visualization.
- Perform __image normalization__ and __convert images__ from __color-scaled to gray-scaled__.
- Build a __Convolutional Neural Network__ using __Keras__ with __Tensorflow 2.0__ as a back-end.
- Compile and __fit Deep Convolutional Neural Network model__ to __training data__.
- Assess the __performance__ of trained Convolutional Neural Network model and ensure its __generalization__ using various KPIs
